Arduino FQBN (fully qualified board name)

> ℹ️ [What's the FQBN string?](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/dev/FAQ/#whats-the-fqbn-string)

> FQBN stands for Fully Qualified Board Name. It has the following format: `VENDOR:ARCHITECTURE:BOARD_ID[:MENU_ID=OPTION_ID[,MENU2_ID=OPTION_ID ...]]`, with each `MENU_ID=OPTION_ID` being an optional key-value pair configuration. Each field accepts letters (`A-Z` or `a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), underscores (`_`), dashes(`-`) and dots(`.`). The special character `=` is accepted in the configuration value. For a deeper understanding of how FQBN works, you should understand the [Arduino platform specification](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/dev/platform-specification/).
